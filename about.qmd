## Abi Prakash

I'm currently a [PhD candidate at the Collaboration on Energy and Envrionmental Markets](https://www.ceem.unsw.edu.au/staff/abhijith-prakash) at UNSW Sydney. 

My PhD work has predominantly looked at how we should approach designing operational practices for balancing power systems and electricity markets with growing penetrations of renewable energy. Much of my work is related to the Australian National Electricity Market (NEM).

Beyond my research work, I have a pretty broad range of interests:

- Political economy of energy transition and climate change
- Policy frameworks and market design for energy systems
- Resource and system (production-cost) modelling through optimisation models
- System-level technical constraints that arise from power flow or power system stability assessments

Always happy to have a chat, so if you're interested in chatting please get in touch.
