## Me

I'm currently a [PhD candidate at the Collaboration on Energy and Envrionmental Markets](https://www.ceem.unsw.edu.au/staff/abhijith-prakash) at UNSW Sydney. 

My PhD work looks at how we might manage short-term risks (those in operational timeframes - milliseconds to days) to balancing supply and demand in power systems and electricity markets with growing penetrations of renewable energy and storage. Assessing and managing these risks requires considering individual resource and system-level technical capabilities and constraints within the context of power system operational practices (including electricity market design) and the broader organisation of the electricity industry. Much of my work is related to the Australian National Electricity Market (NEM).

Beyond my research work, I have a pretty broad range of interests:

- Political economy of energy transition and climate change
- Policy frameworks and market design for energy systems
- Resource and system (production-cost) modelling through optimisation models
- System-level technical constraints that arise from power flow or power system stability assessments

Always happy to have a chat, so if you're interested in chatting please get in touch.
