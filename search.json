    "text": "Originally developed by Nick Gorman, NEMOSIS is a Python package that facilitates downloading historical actual power system and market data from the Australian Energy Market Operator.\nData includes market prices, demand by market region, generator dispatch targets and SCADA data, NEM dispatch engine outputs and market participants bids and offers.\n\n\n\nDeveloped by myself, NEMSEER is a Python package that facilitates downloading historical ahead-of-time (or forecast) power system and market data from the Australian Energy Market Operator.\nNEMSEER provides access to Projected Assessment of System Adequacy (specifically MT, ST and PD PASA) and pre-dispatch (30-minute and 5-minute) data as published by the Australian Energy Market Operator.\nWhereas PASA processes are primarily used to assess resource adequacy based on technical inputs and assumptions for resources in the market (i.e. used to answer questions such as “can operational demand be met in the forecast horizon with a sufficient safety (reserve) margin?”), pre-dispatch processes incorporate the latest set of market participant offers and thus produce regional prices forecasts for energy and frequency control ancillary services.\n\nFor more information, see:\n\nThe glossary for an overview of these ahead-of-time processes and definitions of key terms\nThe quick start for information on how to use NEMSEER\nThe examples page, which include examples of how you can use NEMOSIS alongside NEMSEER to look at demand and price convergence over time.\n\nHere’s an example of what you can do with NEMSEER."

    "text": "The Pluto.jl notebooks below explore pricing outcomes in central dispatch electricity markets such as the Australian National Electricity Market.\n\n\nThis notebook:\n\nExplains how prices are generated from economic dispatch\nProvides an example how co-optimising reserve and energy markets can:\n\nAllow total system costs to be minimised\nEnsure that reserve market pricing accounts for market participants’ opportunity-costs\n\ni.e. the otherwise foregone “profit” that a participant may have received if they provided energy instead of reserves\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis notebook explores unintuitive pricing outcomes associated with multi-period dispatch.\nThe majority of central-dispatch electricity markets (such as the National Electricity Market) operate using single-period dispatch, though several electricity markets in the US have adopted some form of multi-period dispatch and pricing to address ramping over several minutes.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis repository compares several mathematical programming frameworks by using each to optimise a battery energy storage system engaged in energy arbitrage in New South Wales (a NEM market region) in 2021.\nThe repository landing page provides quantitative (time to solve using available solvers) and qualitative assessments (e.g. ease of formulating problem with API) of each framework."

    "text": "I’m a PhD candidate at the Collaboration on Energy and Envrionmental Markets at UNSW Sydney. I’m looking at how risks to system balancing might be managed in power systems and electricity markets with growing penetrations of renewable energy and storage. Much of my work is related to the Australian National Electricity Market (NEM).\nBeyond my research work, I have a pretty broad range of interests:\n\nPolitical economy of energy transition and climate change\nPolicy frameworks and market design for energy systems\nResource and system (production-cost) modelling through optimisation models\nUnderstanding system-level technical constraints that arise from power flow studies and dynamic assessments\n\nAlways happy to have a chat, so if you’re interested in chatting please get in touch."
