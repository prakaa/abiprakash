If you use code or analysis from any of the demand error and/or price convergence examples in the documentation, please also cite NEMOSIS.\nHere are some examples of what you can do with NEMSEER.\n\nDemand Forecast Errors in 2021\n\n\n\n\nEnergy Price Convergence in 2021\nSee this note explaining why we can’t strictly call these price errors."

Both of these are intended outcomes of these “ahead processes”, which are run to provide system and market information to participants to inform their decision-making. However, to avoid confusion and to ensure consistency with the language used by AEMO, I use the terms “forecast” (or outputs) and “forecast types” (or ahead processes) in NEMSEER.↩︎"
