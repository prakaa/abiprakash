# Concepts and Modelling

## Dispatch and market pricing outcomes

The [Pluto.jl](https://github.com/fonsp/Pluto.jl) notebooks below explore pricing outcomes in central dispatch electricity markets such as the Australian National Electricity Market.

### Economic dispatch, co-optimised reserves and opportunity costs 
[This notebook](pluto/ed_reserves_jump.jl.html):

1. Explains how prices are generated from economic dispatch
2. Provides an example how co-optimising reserve and energy markets can:
    - Allow total system costs to be minimised
    - Ensure that reserve market pricing accounts for market participants' opportunity-costs
      - i.e. the otherwise foregone "profit" that a participant may have received if they provided energy instead of reserves

### Multi-period dispatch

[This notebook](pluto/multi_period_ed.jl.html) explores unintuitive pricing outcomes associated with *multi-period* dispatch.

The majority of central-dispatch electricity markets (such as the National Electricity Market) operate using single-period dispatch, though several electricity markets in the US have adopted some form of multi-period dispatch and pricing to address ramping over several minutes.

## Comparing mathematical programming (optimisation) frameworks across Python & Julia

[This repository](https://github.com/prakaa/Battery-Optimisation-Benchmarking) compares several mathematical programming frameworks by using each to optimise a battery energy storage system engaged in energy arbitrage in New South Wales (a NEM market region) in 2021.

The repository landing page provides quantitative (time to solve using available solvers) and qualitative assessments (e.g. ease of formulating problem with API) of each framework.
