# Exploring electricity market pricing concepts

## Dispatch and market pricing outcomes in variations of economic dispatch

The [Pluto.jl](https://github.com/fonsp/Pluto.jl) notebooks below explore pricing outcomes in central dispatch electricity markets such as the Australian National Electricity Market.

### Co-optimised reserves and opportunity costs 
[This notebook](assets/pluto/ed_reserves_jump.jl.html):

1. Explains how prices are generated from economic dispatch
2. Provides an example how co-optimising reserve and energy markets can:
    - Allow total system costs to be minimised
    - Ensure that reserve market pricing accounts for market participants' opportunity-costs
      - i.e. the otherwise foregone "profit" that a participant may have received if they provided energy instead of reserves

### Multi-period dispatch

[This notebook](assets/pluto/multi_period_ed.jl.html) explores unintuitive pricing outcomes associated with *multi-period* dispatch.

The majority of central-dispatch electricity markets (such as the National Electricity Market) operate using single-period dispatch, though several electricity markets in the US have adopted some form of multi-period dispatch and pricing to address ramping over several minutes.
